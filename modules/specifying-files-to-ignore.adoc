= Specifying files to ignore

When you run the `feast apply` command, Feature Store reads all Python files recursively, including Python files in subdirectories, even if the Python files do not contain feature definitions.

If you have Python files, such as imperative scripts,  in your registry folder that you want Feature Store to ignore when you run the  feast apply command, you should create a .feastignore file and add a list of paths to all files that you want Feature Store to ignore.

.Example .feastignore file
----
# Ignore virtual environment
venv

# Ignore a specific Python file
scripts/foo.py

# Ignore all Python files directly under scripts directory
scripts/*.py

# Ignore all "foo.py" anywhere under scripts directory
scripts/**/foo.py
