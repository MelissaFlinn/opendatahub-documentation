=  Feature Store workflow

The Feature Store workflow involves the following tasks OpenShift cluster administrators, and machine learning (ML) engineers or data scientists:	

*Note:* This Feature Store workflow describes a local implementation that is available in this Technology Preview release.

*Cluster administrator*

Installs and configures Feature Store, as described in _Chapter 2. Configuring Feature Store_:

. Installs OpenShift AI.
. Enables the Feature Store component by using the Feature Store operator.
. Creates a data science project.
. In the data science project, creates a Feature Store instance by using a `feast.yaml` file that specifies the offline and online stores.
. Sets up Feature Store so that ML Engineers and data scientists can push and retrieve features to use for model training and inference.

*ML Engineer or data scientist*

* Prepares features, as described in _Chapter 3: Defining features_:
.  Creates a feature definition file.
.  Defines the data sources and other Feature Store objects.
.  Makes features available for real-time inference.

* Prepares features for model training and real-time inference, as described in _Chapter 4. Retrieving features for model training_:
. Makes features available to models.
. Uses `feast` Python APIs to retrieve features for model training and inference.
