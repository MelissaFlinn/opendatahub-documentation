= Audience for Feature Store

The target audience for Feature Store is ML platform and MLOps teams with DevOps experience in deploying real-time models to production. Feature Store also helps these teams build a feature platform that improves collaboration between data engineers, software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists.

For Data Scientists:: Feature Store is a tool where you can define, store, and retrieve your features for both model development and model deployment. By using Feature Store, you can focus on what you do best: build features that power your AI/ML models and maximize the value of your data.

For MLOps Engineers:: Feature Store is a library that connects your existing infrastructure, such as online database, application server, microservice, analytical database, and orchestration tooling. By using Feature Store, you can focus on maintaining a resilient system, instead of implementing features for data scientists.

For Data Engineers:: Feature Store provides a centralized catalog for storing feature definitions, allowing you to maintain a single source of truth for feature data. It provides the abstraction for reading and writing to many different types of offline and online data stores. Using the provided Python SDK or the feature server service, you can write data to the online and offline stores and then read out that data in either batch scenarios for model training or low-latency online scenarios for model inference.

For AI Engineers:: Feature Store provides a platform designed to scale your AI applications by enabling seamless integration of richer data and facilitating fine-tuning. With Feature Store, you can optimize the performance of your AI models while ensuring a scalable and efficient data pipeline.
