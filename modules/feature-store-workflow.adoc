=  Feature Store workflow

The Feature Store workflow involves the following tasks for ML engineers, OpenShift cluster administrators, and data scientists:	

*Note:* This Feature Store workflow describes a local implementation. A production client-server architecture with full authorization and role assignments is planned for a future release.


*ML Engineer*

* Creates a feature definition file.
* Determines and defines the data sources and other feature store objects

For more information, see _Appendix A: Defining features_.


*Cluster administrator*

. Installs OpenShift AI.
. Enables the Feature Store component by using the Feature Store operator.
. Creates a data science project.
. In the data science project, creates a feature store instance by using a `feast.yaml` file that specifies the offline and online stores.
. Handles the initial Feast apply and materialization, making features available to data scientists to use for model inference

For more information, see _Chapter 2. Configuring Feature Store_.

*Data scientist*

. Creates a workbench.
. Obtains the `feature_store.yaml` from the cluster administrator.
. Installs Feature Store in their IDE environment, for example Jupyter.
. Uses `feast` commands to retrieve features for model training

For more information, see _Chapter 3. Retrieving features for model training_.
